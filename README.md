# GPS - Bukkit Plugin

GPS is a bukkit plugin that provides location-based information and compass reorienting.

GPS is currently incomplete but in active development. See TODO.md to see what I'm planning.

## Build

GPS uses Apache Ant for its build system. Run `ant` from the project root to build the jar, which will then be located at dist/GPS.jar.
