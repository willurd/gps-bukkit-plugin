/**
 * GPS - A plugin that provides location-based information and compass
 * reorienting.
 * 
 * Allows players to:
 *   - Point their compass to another player's current location.
 *   - Make their compass follow another player around, and update as
 *     they move.
 *   - Point their compass to spawn.
 *   - Point their compass at a specific set of coordinates.
 * 
 * In the future, will allow players to:
 *   - Save all of their settings so they persist across server runs. ^_^
 *   - Name coordinates and point to them by their names.
 *   - List all of their named coordinates.
 *   - Find out how far (in blocks) they are away from a location
 *     or player.
 *   - Disallow others from locating them using GPS (and reallow).
 *   - See where their compass is currently pointing.
 *   - See the coordinates of a named location or player.
 *   - See the coordinates of where they are currently standing.
 * 
 * See the TODO file for more information on what's planned for GPS.
